### Explanations

#### 1. GitHub account

Do you have a GiHub account already? GitLab, BitBucket, etc. are decent repo storages but they fail to be 
**social networks**. Maybe it's community sizes (cumulative effect), maybe it's a better design and usability (GitLab and BitBucket render 150+ chars per line in `.md` – omg), maybe it's something else. Whatever it is, I can tell you 100% that many recruiters scan GitHub on daily basis, and few of them are even aware of its competitors. You may prefer one's or another's plans for a commercial subscription, but be sure to setup your GitHub account properly anyway, in case you're looking for job opportunities.

#### 2. Language and Grammar

Even if English is not your native language, make sure to have (at least) all your main texts (captions, project descriptions) 
translated to English. Hopefully, I shouldn't explain why. Once you're there, check your grammar.

#### 3. Followings

Start following some developers. GitHub will show you their new projects, their stars, and their own (new) followings.
Which will gradually draw your attention to even more interesting projects and people.

Follow, at least, 20 people. If you aren't sure where to start, start here:

#### 4. Followers

Followers are harder to get, especially for juniors who don't have many things to showcase. 
To get rid of that pesky **0** number, I advice to *exchange* followings. I've created a chat
to make it easier: https://gitter.im/Paqmind/juniors

Leave there a note like:

> @your-github-username
> https://github.com/your-github-username

When people start following you (you get a GitHub notification on Home page), follow them in return. Your goal is to get 10+ followers for your account to not look "green". It doesn't matter who those followers really are (unless they are bots). P.S. Write in English only, please. *Please don't follow ME for this particular reason – I won't be able to follow you back.*

#### 4. Stars

Check the pages of people you now follow. Give stars to their projects you find interesting. Big corps like
Facebook may get thousands of stars for nothing, for publishing empty repos literally, while many great individual
projects are extremely underrated. Don't follow the crowd – the less popular is a project you're starring, the more
appreciation you get in return. As a rule of thumb, it's much easier to find a way to communicate with authors of 
smaller projects, they don't have enough attention. On the other hand, supporters of mainstream projects like TypeScript, React, etc. 
are very busy and tired answering [thousands](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues) of questions and, in general,
won't be as friendly and patient.

Give, at least, 50 stars. My list, just for reference:

#### 5. Forks

Empty account does not necessary mean you're lazy and got nothing to discuss, but it doesn't add you anything good either.
The simplest way to fill your account is to make forks. You make forks to send Pull Requests (later) so I propose you to 
do the following.

1. Find open source projects you'd like to contribute to.
2. Fork them.
3. Find something you may improve. Your initial help may be as small as a single typo.
4. Send a PR. Don't be afraid to communicate if necessary – GitHub has a welcoming community.

Make, at least, 10 forks.
