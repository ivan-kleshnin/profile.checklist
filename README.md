## Explanations

### 1. Resume

#### Sections

No matter how well written, your resume won't get a thorough reading the first time through. Generally a resume gets scanned for 10–25 seconds. Scanning is more difficult if it's hard to read, poorly organized or exceeds two pages.

* **Header**
* **Summary**
* **Experience**
* **Skills**

#### Header

(TODO)

#### Summary

The **most important** section of your resume is the pitch, often called Summary.
It takes about 5 sentences where you explain what you're great at, most interested in, and how you can be useful to to your potential employer. Weak summary = No Job. You have to rewrite your summary from scratch as many times as you need to achieve the perfect result. It should be short, outstanding, and memorable at the same time.

**Concrete Recipe:**

1. A short phrase describing your profession
2. Followed by a statement of a broad or specialized expertise
3. Followed by 2–3 statements emphasizing your TOP selling points. 
  * breadth or depth of skills
  * unique mix of skills
  * range of environments in which you have experience
  * a special or well-documented accomplishment
  * a history of awards, promotions, or superior performance recommendations
4. One or more professional or appropriate personal characteristics
5. One sentence describing professional objective or interest.

#### Accomplishments

Identify accomplishments not just job descriptions.

HRs seek candidates that can help them solve a problem or satisfy company's needs. Consequently, you can't be a solution to their problems without stating how you solved similar problems in other companies and situations.

Focus on what you did in the job – don't just claim "my job was X".
Accomplishments should be unique to you, not just a list of what someone else did.
Avoid being vague and generic – the more specific are your claims, the better.

#### Skills

Avoid repetitions and redundancy: HTML, XML, XHTML, HTML5, DHTML... HTML5 or just HTML is enough, given that modern search engines will
consider your text relevant for all the others. And unless you're a Java developer – you can easily forget about XML. Same goes for 
CSS3. Those numbers don't add value to your knowledge, they are mostly visual clutter. Avoid skills like Microsoft Word, Markdown and other skills you must have by definition. If you don't have anything else to put there – it's probably too early for you to look for a programming job.

Don't list years of experience with each tech. Those years will hardly be accurate and don't add anything valueable to a reader. If you have a big experience with PHP – state it explicitly in your summary. Your projects and work history prove your skills much better than abstract "years spent".

Avoid progress bars. They assume you know exactly the amount of knowledge in the specific area and those particular bits you're missing. Which is, most probably, a big lie.

#### Style

Use a logical format and wide margins, clean type, big and contrasty font and clear headings. Selectively apply bold and italic typeface 
that help guide the reader's eye. Use bullets to call attention to important points (i.e. accomplishments).

#### Goals

(TODO)

#### Interests

(TODO)

#### Things to avoid

Every word on your resume takes up valuable space, and you shouldn't waste it with things that clearly make no difference at an initial resume assessment. Use common sense and for each word you add, ask yourself: does this piece of information help the employer decide whether or not to call me for an interview?

I recommend removing all of the following pieces of information from your resume:
* Age or Birthday
* Marital / relationship status
* Gender / Sexual orientation
* Ethnicity / Nationality / Immigration Status
* Social Security Number
* Driver's license (how does being a driver help you as a developer?)
* Full address (city and state/country are fine if you want to give a general idea)
* Irrelevant hobbies

#### Photo

> This is certainly a controversial topic, but personally speaking, I see no problem with it. Profile photos are everywhere on the web and you probably have them on LinkedIn, Github and a bunch of other sites. I don't see why you shouldn't be supposed to add them to your resume if you want to. Resumes with good-quality photos bring a human connection and empathy that might even give you an advantage.
> Some say it's not professional, but I can't see what's so unprofessional about showing your face. Others say hiring managers could judge based on looks. To be honest, I prefer to assume good faith and believe that employers are looking for talent and, especially for developer roles, no one cares about looks. A smile brings people together and doesn't cause any harm IMHO.
> Obviously, it's also totally acceptable not to add a photo as well and no job application should require one.

### 2. Profiles

Do you have a GiHub account already? GitLab, BitBucket, etc. are decent repo storages but they fail to be 
**social networks**. Maybe it's community sizes (cumulative effect), maybe it's a better design and usability (GitLab and BitBucket render 150+ chars per line in `.md` – omg), maybe it's something else. Whatever it is, I can tell you 100% that many recruiters scan GitHub on daily basis, and few of them are even aware of its competitors. You may prefer one's or another's plans for a commercial subscription, but be sure to setup your GitHub account properly anyway, in case you're looking for job opportunities.

English may be not your native language, but make sure to have (at least) all your main texts (captions, project descriptions) 
translated to English. Hopefully, I shouldn't explain why. Once you're there, check your grammar.

### 2.1 GitHub Profile

#### Followings

Start to follow some developers. GitHub will show you their new projects, their stars, and their own (new) followings.
Which will keep drawing your attention to more interesting projects and people in the future. 

Follow, at least, 20 people. If you aren't sure where to start, start here:
* https://github.com/ivan-kleshnin?tab=following

#### Followers

Followers are harder to get, especially for juniors who don't have many things to showcase. 
To get rid of that pesky **0** number, I advice to *exchange* followings. I've created a chat
to make it easier: https://gitter.im/Paqmind/juniors

Leave there a note like:

> @your-github-username
> https://github.com/your-github-username

When people start following you (you get a GitHub notification on Home page), follow them in return. It doesn't matter who those followers really are (unless they are bots). You'll be able to unfollow irrelevant people later (and find more interesting to you).
As a rule of thum, the less followers has a person you follow – the more chance they'll follow you back. So don't try to tempt Sindre Sorhus to follow you – focus on your circle.

Get, at least 10 followers in this way. *Please don't follow ME only for this particular reason – I'm not able to follow you back (my contact list is established at this point).*

#### Stars

Now check the profiles of people you follow. Give stars to their projects you find interesting. Big corps like
Facebook may publish empty repos and get thousands of stars literally, while so many great individual projects are underrated and undiscovered. Don't follow the crowd – the less popular is a project you're starring, the more appreciation you get in return. 

Again, as a rule of thumb, it's much easier to find a way to communicate with authors of smaller projects as they don't get enough attention.  On the other hand, supporters of mainstream projects like TypeScript, React, etc. are very busy and tired answering [thousands](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues) of newbie questions. Don't expect them to be nearly as friendly and patient.

People are notified when you star their repos. So, when you do that for a relatively unknown projects, – chances are high those
people will check your account and maybe star some of YOUR repos back. Starring Facebook's, Google's, Microsoft's stuff is worthless.
And, before your ask, – no, recruiters won't consider your &starf; to Angular as a proof you know it.

A bit later, when you'll have your own projects you'd like other people to know about – star them!
Your followers see your starring actions, including stars for your own project. There's absolutely nothing
shameful in starring your own repos – it's just a way to notify your subscribers. It's not like "favoriting your own comment on YouTube"
or something. The only way you can abuse it – multiple starring and unstarring the same project (to send multiple notifications). Don't do that.

Give, at least, 50 stars to different projects. My list, just for reference:
* https://github.com/ivan-kleshnin?tab=stars

#### Forks

Empty portfolio does not necessary mean you're lazy and have nothing to show, but it doesn't say anything good about you either.
The simplest way to fill your project list is to make forks. You make forks to send Pull Requests (later) so I propose you to 
do the following:

1. Find open source projects you'd like to contribute to.
2. Fork them. It takes a couple of seconds per fork.

Forks don't have fork dates so your list won't look fake. Of course, I expect you to give, at least,
5 minutes of consideration to each repo you fork. Just don't take it more serious that it should be, –
nobody's spying on you, tracking and judging your every move, except yourself.

Make, at least, 10 forks. Start with a list of projects you starred previously. Go further.

#### PRs

It's getting harder from this point. Things you do aren't mechanical anymore, but aren't "rocket science" either.
You have a list of projects. You have to contribute something to them.

Find something you may improve. Your initial help may be as small as a single typo in docs. And it's probably 
a good idea to start with such contributions – you don't risk anything to "go wrong" or to "look stupid".

Prepare and send, at least, 5 PRs. Start with a list of projects you forked previosly. Don't hesisate to go beyond.
Don't be afraid to communicate if necessary – GitHub has a welcoming community.
