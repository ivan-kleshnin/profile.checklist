# Profile Checklist

### Options

#### 1. GitHub account

Do you have a GiHub account already? GitLab, BitBucket, etc. are decent repo storages but they fail to be 
**social networks**. Maybe it's the size of community, maybe it's a better design and usability (GitLab and BitBucket can't even set a proper line width to read markdown properly...), maybe it's something else. Whatever it is, I can tell you 100% that many recruiters scan GitHub on daily basis, and few are even aware of its competitors. So use what you want for the commercial stuff, but be sure to find a time to setup your GitHub account properly, if you're looking for job opportunities.

#### 2. Language and Grammar

Even if English is not your native language, make sure to have (at least) all your main texts (captions, project descriptions) 
translated to English. Hopefully, I shouldn't explain why. Once you're there, check your grammar.

#### 3. Followings

Start following some developers. GitHub will show you their new projects, their stars, and their own (new) followings.
Which will gradually draw your attention to even more interesting projects and people.

#### 4. Stars

Check the pages of people you now follow. Give stars to their projects you find interesting. Big corps like
Facebook may get thousands of stars for nothing, for publishing empty repos literally, while many great individual
projects are extremely underrated. Don't follow the crowd – the less popular is a project you're starring, the more
appreciation you get in return. As a rule of thumb, it's much easier to find a way to communicate with authors of 
smaller projects, they don't have enough attention. On the other hand, supporters of mainstream projects like TypeScript, React, etc. 
are very busy and tired answering [thousands](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues) of questions and, in general,
won't be as friendly and patient.

#### 5. Forks

Empty account does not necessary mean you're lazy and got nothing to discuss, but it doesn't add you anything good either.
The simplest way to fill your account is to make forks. You make forks to send Pull Requests (later) so I propose you to 
do the following.

1. Find open source projects you'd like to contribute to.
2. Fork them.
3. Find something you may improve. Your initial help may be as small as a single typo.
4. Send a PR. Don't be afraid to communicate if necessary – GitHub has a welcoming community.
