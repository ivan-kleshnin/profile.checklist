## Explanations

### Accounts

#### GitHub account

Do you have a GiHub account already? GitLab, BitBucket, etc. are decent repo storages but they fail to be 
**social networks**. Maybe it's community sizes (cumulative effect), maybe it's a better design and usability (GitLab and BitBucket render 150+ chars per line in `.md` – omg), maybe it's something else. Whatever it is, I can tell you 100% that many recruiters scan GitHub on daily basis, and few of them are even aware of its competitors. You may prefer one's or another's plans for a commercial subscription, but be sure to setup your GitHub account properly anyway, in case you're looking for job opportunities.

### Resume

#### Language and Grammar

English may be not your native language, but make sure to have (at least) all your main texts (captions, project descriptions) 
translated to English. Hopefully, I shouldn't explain why. Once you're there, check your grammar.

### GitHub Profile

#### Followings

Start to follow some developers. GitHub will show you their new projects, their stars, and their own (new) followings.
Which will keep drawing your attention to more interesting projects and people in the future. 

Follow, at least, 20 people. If you aren't sure where to start, start here:
* https://github.com/ivan-kleshnin?tab=following

#### Followers

Followers are harder to get, especially for juniors who don't have many things to showcase. 
To get rid of that pesky **0** number, I advice to *exchange* followings. I've created a chat
to make it easier: https://gitter.im/Paqmind/juniors

Leave there a note like:

> @your-github-username
> https://github.com/your-github-username

When people start following you (you get a GitHub notification on Home page), follow them in return. It doesn't matter who those followers really are (unless they are bots). You'll be able to unfollow irrelevant people later (and find more interesting to you).
As a rule of thum, the less followers has a person you follow – the more chance they'll follow you back. So don't try to tempt Sindre Sorhus to follow you – focus on your circle.

Get, at least 10 followers in this way. *Please don't follow ME only for this particular reason – I'm not able to follow you back (my contact list is established at this point).*

#### Stars

Now check the profiles of people you follow. Give stars to their projects you find interesting. Big corps like
Facebook may publish empty repos and get thousands of stars literally, while so many great individual projects are underrated and undiscovered. Don't follow the crowd – the less popular is a project you're starring, the more appreciation you get in return. 

Again, as a rule of thumb, it's much easier to find a way to communicate with authors of smaller projects as they don't get enough attention.  On the other hand, supporters of mainstream projects like TypeScript, React, etc. are very busy and tired answering [thousands](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues) of newbie questions. Don't expect them to be nearly as friendly and patient.

People are notified when you star their repos. So, when you do that for a relatively unknown projects, – chances are high those
people will check your account and maybe star some of YOUR repos back. Starring Facebook's, Google's, Microsoft's stuff is worthless.
And, before your ask, – no, recruiters won't consider your &starf; to Angular as a proof you know it.

A bit later, when you'll have your own projects you'd like other people to know about – star them!
Your followers see your starring actions, including stars for your own project. There's absolutely nothing
shameful in starring your own repos – it's just a way to notify your subscribers. It's not like "favoriting your own comment on YouTube"
or something. The only way you can abuse it – multiple starring and unstarring the same project (to send multiple notifications). Don't do that.

Give, at least, 50 stars to different projects. My list, just for reference:
* https://github.com/ivan-kleshnin?tab=stars

#### Forks

Empty portfolio does not necessary mean you're lazy and have nothing to show, but it doesn't say anything good about you either.
The simplest way to fill your project list is to make forks. You make forks to send Pull Requests (later) so I propose you to 
do the following:

1. Find open source projects you'd like to contribute to.
2. Fork them. It takes a couple of seconds per fork.

Forks don't have fork dates so your list won't look fake. Of course, I expect you to give, at least,
5 minutes of consideration to each repo you fork. Just don't take it more serious that it should be, –
nobody's spying on you, tracking and judging your every move, except yourself.

Make, at least, 10 forks. Start with a list of projects you starred previously. Go further.

#### PRs

It's getting harder from this point. Things you do aren't mechanical anymore, but aren't "rocket science" either.
You have a list of projects. You have to contribute something to them.

Find something you may improve. Your initial help may be as small as a single typo in docs. And it's probably 
a good idea to start with such contributions – you don't risk anything to "go wrong" or to "look stupid".

Prepare and send, at least, 5 PRs. Start with a list of projects you forked previosly. Don't hesisate to go beyond.
Don't be afraid to communicate if necessary – GitHub has a welcoming community.
